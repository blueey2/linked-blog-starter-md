# **Explain the characteristics of network topologies and network types.**

## Network Topologies
#### Star Topology
All computers are connected to a central wiring point such as a hub or switch.
All data on a star network passes through this central point before going to there destination.
#### Ring Topology
Each computer is connected to each other in the shape of a closed loop.
Every computer on this ring has two neighbors for communication purpose.
**Advantages**
	Easy to install/Troubleshoot
**Disadvantage**
	Not redundant
#### Bus Topology
Each of the computer/network devices are connected via a single cable or backbone. (Coaxial Cable)
**Advantages**
	Cheap and easy to implement
#### Mesh Topology
Each computer on the network is connected to every other computer on the network
**Advantages**
	High Redundancy
	Expensive

## Wireless Topologies
#### Ad Hoc
All devices wireless connect to the other devices in peer-to-peer network.
Useful for setting up a quick wireless network on the fly.

# Network Types
#### Peer-to-peer
All devices are both clients and servers
	Everyone Talks to everyone
**Advantages**
	Easy to deploy
	low cost
**Disadvantages**
	Difficult to administor
	Difficult to secure
#### Client-Server
Central server
	Client talks to the server
No client-to-client communication
**Advantages**
	Performance, administration
**Disadvantages**
	Cost, Complexity

#### NAS vs SAN
Network attached storage (NAS)
	Connect to a shared storage device across the network
	File-level acess
Storage area network (SAN)
	Block-level access
	Very efficient reading and writing
	Requires alot of bandwidth
#### MPLS(Multiprotocol Label Switching)
Communication through the WAN, but uses lables to be able to determine how we route and forward that traffic through the lan
**Advantages**
	Any transport medium, Any protocol inside

#### mGRE(Multipoint generic routing encapsulation)
