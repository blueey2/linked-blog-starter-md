CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
	A community managed list of vulnerabilities
IGMP Snooping (Internet group management protocol)
	Hosts and routers use IGMP to direct multicast transmissions
	Configured in a switch
Port tagging
	Tag traffic with VLAN info then send it across the network the tag is ripped off and placed where the tag says it supposed to be.
DHCP Relay
	Puts DHCP server on a distance subnet
Anycast
	Single destination IP address has multiple paths to two or more endpoints
CRC Error
	Faulty cables
ARP
	Associate a devices MAC address with an IP address
IFCONFIG
	View the subnet mask of a linux computer
CNAME
	Tells DNS to use different names for a paticular server/service
MX
	Determines the host name for the mail server
Crossover Cable
	A type of ethernet cable used to directly connect two similar devices, Such as two computer or two switches, without the need for an intermediary networking device like a router
		
Rollover cable
	Special type of serial cable used to connect a computer or terminal to a networking device for the purpose of configuring, monitoring, or troubleshooting the device.
		Devices typically include network routers, switches and firewalls
Straight through Cable
	A common type of ethernet cable used to connect different types of network devices, such as computers to switches, routers, to modems, or similar scenarios.
T1
	A digital telecommunications service that provides high speed, dedicated, and reliable data transmission over a telecommunications network. Widely used for voice and data communication.
		**Characteristics**
			Has a data rate of 1,544 MBPS.
			Typically divided into 24 individual channels, with each channel capable of carrying data or voice.
			T1 Connections are usually point-to-point connections

Fiber light meter
	An instrument used in the field of fiber optics and optical communication to measure the optical power or intensity of light in a fiber optic cable
OTDR
	A specialized instrument used to troubleshooting optical fiber cablesDef
Broadcast storm
	A situation in which a network segment experiences an excessive and uncontrolled volume of broadcast or multicast traffic.
		**Effects**
			Leads to network congestions, degradation in performance, and even network outages if not promptly addressed.
Asymmetric routing
	A routing configuration where incoming and outgoing network traffic between two devices or networks follows the same path in both directions.
Collisions
	Occur in ethernet based networks, specifically in shared media environments like ethernet  hubs or older ethernet networks using a shared coaxial cable.
VLAN Hopping
	Vlan hopping occurs when an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in network devices or protocols to gain unauthorized access to traffic on a vlan other than the one they are supposed to be on.
Rogue DHCP
	An unauthorized and potentially malicious DHCP server that operates on a network without the knowledge or approval of the network administrators.
QoS(Quality of service)
	A set of technologies and practices used in networking to manage and prioritize network traffic, ensuring that certain types of data receive preferential treatment to meet specific performance and service level objectives
Cold site
	A disaster recovery solution that provides the least level of readiness and the lowest cost.
Warm site
	An intermediate level of disaster recovery readiness
Hot site
	The highest level of disaster recovery preparedness and offers the quickest recovery times. Most expensive
IP helper
	A network configuration feature commonly found in routers and layer 3 switches. Its used to facilitate the routing and forwarding of network traffic between different subnets or broadcast domains by assisting certain network services that rely on broadcasts or multicast traffic
Business continuity plan
	A comprehensive and proactive strategy developed by an organization to ensure its ability to continue essential operations deliver critical services and recover from disruptive events or disasters.
Crosstalk
	The unwanted interference or coupling of signals between adjacent conductors or communcation channels.
	It occurs when the electromagnetic fields generated by one signal affect or induce volatages in nearby conductors or cables leading to singal distortion degradation or interference
STP states (Learning, Forwarding, Listening, Blocking)
	**Blocking State**
		A switch port does not participate in frame forwarding, the switch listens to the BDPU from neighboring switches to determine the networks topology.
	**Listening state**
		During this state, the port is still not forwarding frames, but it actively participates in the STP network convergence process by sending and receiving BDPUs.
	**Learning state**
		The switch continues to sewnd and receive BGPUs, and it also starts to learn MAC addresses from incoming frames
	**Forwarding state**
		The port actively forwards frames between devices connected to it
