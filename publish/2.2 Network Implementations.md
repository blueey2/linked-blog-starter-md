# Compare and contrast routing technologies and bandwidth management concepts.

## Dynamic Routing Protocols
####  Routing Internet Protocol (RIP)
A distance vector routing protocol used for small to medium-sized networks. It measures distance in terms of hop count and updates routing tables at regular intervals.

#### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
A link-state routing protocol that's more efficient and scalable than RIP. It calculates the shortest path to a destination based on a detailed map of the network.

#### Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
A Cisco proprietary hybrid routing protocol that combines aspects of both distance vector and link-state routing. It's designed for large and complex networks.

#### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
An exterior gateway protocol used for routing between different autonomous systems (ASes) on the Internet. It's a path vector protocol, considering more factors than just hop count for routing decisions.

#### Link State
Maintains a detailed map of the network and calculate the shortest path based on this map. Examples include OSPF and IS-IS.

#### Distance Vector
Routing protocols, like RIP, calculate routes based on the number of hops between routers and periodically exchange routing tables.

#### Hybrid
Routing protocols, like EIGRP, combine elements of both link state and distance vector routing to provide more flexibility and efficiency.

#### Static Routing
The process of manually configuring network routes by an administrator. It doesn't adapt to network changes automatically and is often used for specific, fixed paths in a network.

#### Default Route
Often denoted as 0.0.0.0, is used when a router doesn't have a specific route entry for a destination. It's a catch-all route that directs traffic to a predefined gateway.

#### Administrative Distance
A measure of the trustworthiness of a routing source. It's used to determine which routing information to prioritize when multiple sources provide route information for the same destination

#### Exterior Routing
These protocols are used to route traffic between different autonomous systems on the Internet. BGP is the primary EGP used for this purpose.

#### Interior Routing
These protocols are used within an autonomous system (AS) to route traffic within the organization's network. Examples include RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP.

## Bandwidth Management

#### Traffic Shaping
A network management technique that regulates the flow of data on a network to ensure a smoother and more predictable traffic pattern.

#### Quality of Service(QoS)
A set of techniques and mechanisms used to manage and improve the performance and reliability of network services. Allows network administrators to prioritize different types of data traffic based on specific criteria like latency, bandwidth, and packet loss.
