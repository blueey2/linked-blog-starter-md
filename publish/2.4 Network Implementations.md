## Service set Identifier
#### Basic Service Set (BSS)
The basic building block of a wireless LAN. It consists of a single access point (AP) and the wireless devices connected to it.
#### Extended Service set (ESS)
This configuration is used to extend the coverage area of a wireless network.
#### Independent Basic Service Set (Ad-hoc)
A decentralized network where wireless devices communicate directly with each other without the need for a central access point.
#### Roaming
The ability of a wireless device to move from one BSS to another, or between APs in an ESS, while maintaining an uninterrupted network connection.

## Encryption Standards

#### WPA/WPA2 Personal (AES/TKIP)
They provide encryption to protect the data transmitted between devices and the wireless access point.
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and TKIP are encryption algorithms used within these standards.
AES is a strong encryption method, while TKIP is older and less secure. AES uses the newer protocol
#### WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (AES/TKIP)
They offer higher security levels compared to WPA/WPA2 Personal.
AES and TKIP can be used with these standards, but it's recommended to use AES for the best security.
#### CDMA
A cellular technology used for transmitting digital data over a mobile network.
It allows multiple devices to share the same frequency spectrum by assigning a unique code to each device for signal separation.
#### GSM
A widely used standard for mobile communication.
It uses a SIM card for user authentication and encryption for secure communication.
#### LTE
A high-speed wireless communication standard commonly used for 4G mobile networks.
It provides faster data transfer rates and improved network performance.
