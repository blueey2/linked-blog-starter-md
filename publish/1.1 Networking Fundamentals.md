# **Compare and contrast the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layers and encapsulation concepts**

# **OSI Model**
## Physical layer
Data is referred to as **BITS** at the physical layer
**Devices at Layer 1**
	Ethernet Cable
	Fiber optic cable
	Network Interface card
	Hub
Also we figure out what type of topology we use at this layer.
## Data link layer
Data is referred to as **frames** at the data link link
**MAC(Media Access Control)**
	Physical Addressing
		48bit address that makes a device unique from every other device.
	Logical Topology
	Method Of Transmission
**LLC (Logical Link Control)**
	Connection Services
	Synchronization of Transmissions
	**Devices at Layer 2**
		Layer 2 Switch
## Network Link Layer
Data is referred to as **packets** at the Network link layer
**Logical Addressing**
**Devices**
	Router
	Layer 3 Switch
**Switching**
	Packet switching
		Making a forwarding decision 
**Connection Services**
	Flow Control
## Transport Layer
Data is referred to as **segments** at the Transport layer
**TCP/UDP**
**Windowing**
**Buffering**
## Session layer
**Setting up a Session**
	Exchanging parameters that are gonna be used during the session
**Maintaining a Session**
	Making sure things aren't getting dropped
**Tearing Down a Session**
	Stopping Communication
## Presentation Layer
**Data Formatting**
	A standard for how everything is constructed. (EX: Jpgs, Pngs, Jpegs, ASCII)
**Encryption**
	End to end Encryption
## Application layer
**Application Services**
	Underlying services that help your applications run
		EX: If you using outlook some services you would use art SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, ETC
**Service Advertisement**
	A device on the network wants to offer service to any other device it lets everyone on the network know.
		EX: Apple Air print
