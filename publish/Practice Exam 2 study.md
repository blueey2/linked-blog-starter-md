**Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)**
	Used to group numerous physical ports to make on high bandwidth path.
		_This method can increase bandwidth and therefore, throughput_

**Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**
	A network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for ethernet networks to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast storms that result from them
		_This method accomplishes loop prevention and network redundancy management in ethernet networks by creating a loop-free topology and disabling redundant paths._
		
**Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BDPU)**
	Used by STP to prevent the bridge loops
		_Exchanges information between network bridges in order to prevent loops and ensure efficient data forwarding in Ethernet Networks_

**Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)**
	A computer networking Protocol that provides for automatic assignment of avaiable internet protocol routers to participating hosts.
		_Accomplishes high Availability and failover in a network by allowing multiple routers to work together as a virtual router, ensuring continuous connectivity in case of a router failure_
**Routing Information Protocol (RIPv1)**
	Prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. Does not support VLSM.
		_Accomplishes basic routing by exchanging routing information between routers in a network, allowing them to maintain and update their routing tables to make routing decisions_

**Open shortest path first (OSPF)**
	Link state routing protocol that was developed for IP networks and is based on the shortest path first Algorithm. Supports IPv4 and VLSM.
		_Used in computer networks to determine the best path for data packets to travel within a network, based on factors like network topology and link costs_
