# Explain basic corporate and datacenter network architecture.

## Three-Tiered

#### Core
The high-speed, high-capacity backbone of a network that efficiently and reliably forwards data between different parts of the network.

#### Distribution/Aggregation Layer
Serves as an intermediary between the core and access layers, aggregating and distributing traffic from access layer switches to the core.

#### Access/Edge Layer
Where end-user devices connect to the network. It provides network access to devices, enforces security policies, and manages connectivity for end-user devices like computers and phones.

## Software-Defined Networking

#### Application layer
A network architecture that separates the control plane (decision-making) from the data plane (traffic forwarding) to make networks more flexible, programmable, and easier to manage.

#### Application layer
The top layer of the SDN architecture responsible for running software applications that interact with the network. It includes services and applications that utilize network resources.

#### Control Layer
The middle layer of the SDN architecture that centralizes control and management functions. It makes decisions about how data traffic should flow through the network based on input from the application layer.

#### Infrastructure layer
The bottom layer of the SDN architecture that comprises the physical network devices (e.g., switches, routers) and the data plane responsible for forwarding network traffic. It follows instructions from the control layer.

#### Management plane
A component that runs in parallel with the control layer and is responsible for the overall management and monitoring of the network. It handles tasks like configuration, monitoring, and security policies.

## Spine and leaf

#### Software-Defined network
A network architecture that separates the control plane (which manages network traffic and policies) from the data plane (which handles the actual forwarding of data packets).

#### Top-of-Rack Switching
A data center networking design where a network switch is placed at the top of each server rack. These switches connect the servers within the rack to the data center network.

#### Backbone
The main high-speed network infrastructure that connects various smaller networks or segments within an organization.

## Branch office vs on-premises datacenter vs colocation

#### Branch Office
A remote office or location that is part of a larger organization.

#### On-premises Datacenter
A physical facility or data center located within an organization's own premises or buildings.

#### Colocation
A data center facility where multiple organizations rent space to house their servers and networking equipment.

## Storage area networks

#### Fibre Channel over ethernet (FCoE)
A protocol that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames within Ethernet frames. It allows Fibre Channel traffic to run over existing Ethernet infrastructure, reducing the need for separate network infrastructure.

#### Fibre Channel
A high-speed, dedicated network technology designed for storage and data retrieval. It provides low-latency, high-throughput connections between servers and storage devices.

#### Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)
A protocol that allows block-level storage data to be transported over IP networks, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the internet.
