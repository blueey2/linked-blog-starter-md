# Explain basic corporate and datacenter network architecture.

## Three-Tiered

#### Core
The high-speed, high-capacity backbone of a network that efficiently and reliably forwards data between different parts of the network.

#### Distribution/Aggregation Layer
Serves as an intermediary between the core and access layers, aggregating and distributing traffic from access layer switches to the core.

#### Access/Edge Layer
Where end-user devices connect to the network. It provides network access to devices, enforces security policies, and manages connectivity for end-user devices like computers and phones.

## Software-Defined Networking

#### Application layer
A network architecture that separates the control plane (decision-making) from the data plane (traffic forwarding) to make networks more flexible, programmable, and easier to manage.

#### Application layer
The top layer of the SDN architecture responsible for running software applications that interact with the network. It includes services and applications that utilize network resources.

#### Control Layer
The middle layer of the SDN architecture that centralizes control and management functions. It makes decisions about how data traffic should flow through the network based on input from the application layer.

#### Infrastructure layer
The bottom layer of the SDN architecture that comprises the physical network devices (e.g., switches, routers) and the data plane responsible for forwarding network traffic. It follows instructions from the control layer.

#### Management plane
A component that runs in parallel with the control layer and is responsible for the overall management and monitoring of the network. It handles tasks like configuration, monitoring, and security policies.
