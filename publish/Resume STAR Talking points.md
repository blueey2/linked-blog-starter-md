Habitat for humanity
	In my previous role, I upgraded home networks by setting up advanced solutions with routers and access points. This significantly improved connectivity and overall tech capabilities. I also took the lead in organizing training sessions for a team of volunteers, boosting their efficiency and effectiveness, which directly improved our workflow. My experience highlights my knack for implementing effective networking solutions and leading teams to better performance through training.
Splunk LAB
	In my experience with Splunk, I established and configured the system in a home lab environment, handling everything from installation to data input configuration and indexing. I showcased proficiency in setting up a comprehensive Splunk infrastructure for effective log management, managing end-to-end data ingestion processes with a meticulous approach to handling and optimizing data for efficient analysis. I also implemented robust security measures, including access controls, encryption, and auditing, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of log data. These actions not only fortified the system against potential threats but also highlighted my commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data security. Overall, my experience with Splunk demonstrates my ability to create and manage a secure and efficient log management system.
Packet Tracer
	I orchestrated the implementation of OSPF in a controlled lab environment, demonstrating adept skills in configuring and optimizing dynamic routing protocols. I methodically verified the functionality of connections, ensuring the establishment of a robust and reliable network infrastructure. Additionally, I implemented functional DHCP for multiple end devices in a lab setting, showcasing expertise in dynamic addressing and efficient resource allocation. These hands-on experiences underscore my strong foundation in networking principles, highlighting my ability to not only configure and optimize routing protocols but also to ensure the seamless and efficient operation of network services in practical settings.
Active Directory
	I successfully established and configured a Windows Server virtual environment, where I adeptly created an Active Directory Domain Controller. This task required implementing comprehensive configurations to guarantee seamless functionality. I demonstrated my expertise by applying strategic Group Policy edits, enforcing robust security settings and configurations. This showcased my keen understanding of network security protocols and actively contributed to enhancing the system's overall security posture. These actions not only fortified the environment against potential security threats but also highlighted my proficiency in Active Directory management and policy enforcement. My experience underscores my ability to create and manage a secure and efficiently functioning Windows Server virtual environment.


Tell me about your experience
	My first role as IT support I and other volunteers we setup and configured routers and access points in newly constructed homes making sure they had internet that was configured and properly setup. Also I have experience setting up and configuring Active Directory on virtual machines. That included group policy edits, creating user profiles and password resets.  I also configured and setup splunk in a virtual environment creating dashboards of certain alerts I want it to pick up (Clearing logs etc).
