Habitat for humanity
	In my previous role, I upgraded home networks in newly built residences by setting up advanced solutions with routers and access points, including brands like Linksys and TP-Link. This significantly improved connectivity and overall tech capabilities. I also took the lead in organizing training sessions for a team of volunteers, boosting their efficiency and effectiveness, which directly improved our workflow. My experience highlights my knack for implementing effective networking solutions and leading teams to better performance through training.
Splunk LAB
	In my experience with Splunk, I established and configured the system in a home lab environment, handling everything from installation to data input configuration and indexing. I showcased proficiency in setting up a comprehensive Splunk infrastructure for effective log management, managing end-to-end data ingestion processes with a meticulous approach to handling and optimizing data for efficient analysis. I also implemented robust security measures, including access controls, encryption, and auditing, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of log data. These actions not only fortified the system against potential threats but also highlighted my commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data security. Overall, my experience with Splunk demonstrates my ability to create and manage a secure and efficient log management system.
