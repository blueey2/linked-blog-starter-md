# Given a scenario, configure a subnet and use appropriate IP addressing schemes.

## Public vs Private

#### RFC1918
Defines reserved IP address ranges for private networks.

#### Network Address Translation (NAT)
A network technology that allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for internet access.

#### Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)
A unique address assigned to network devices, primarily used in Ethernet networks.
EX: Mac address

#### Multicast
A network communication method where data is sent from one sender to multiple specifically selected recipients.

#### Unicast
A network communication method where data is sent from one sender to one specific recipient.

#### Anycast
A network addressing and routing method that sends data to the nearest or most appropriate of a group of potential receivers, often used for redundancy.

#### Broadcast
A network communication method where data is sent from one sender to all devices on a network segment.

## IPV6 Concepts

#### Tunneling
A technique used to encapsulate one network protocol within another for the purpose of transmitting data over networks that wouldn't normally support the enclosed protocol.

#### Dual Stack
A network configuration that enables the simultaneous support of both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.

#### Shorthand Notation
A compact way of representing IPv6 addresses by compressing consecutive blocks of zeros with a double colon (::).

#### Router Advertisement
A part of the IPv6 protocol, where routers on a network periodically send messages to announce their presence and provide network configuration information to neighboring devices.

#### Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
A method in IPv6 for automatically assigning unique IP addresses to devices on a network without the need for a central DHCP server.
