# Compare and contrast common types of attacks.
## Technology Based
#### Denial-Of-Service (DOS)
An attempt to make a computer, network, or service unavailable to its intended users. Attackers flood the target with excessive traffic or overload its resources to disrupt normal operations.
#### Distributed Denial-of-service (Ddos)
An evolved form of DoS attack where multiple compromised computers, often part of a botnet, are used to simultaneously flood a target system with traffic, making it even harder to defend against.
#### Botnet
A collection of compromised computers controlled by a central server. The attacker uses these "zombie" machines to carry out tasks, such as DDoS attacks, without the owners' knowledge.
#### On-Path-attack (MITM)
Involves an attacker intercepting and potentially altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.
#### DNS Poisoning
An attack where the DNS (Domain Name System) records are manipulated to redirect users to malicious websites. It can lead to phishing attacks and other security breaches.
#### VLAN Hopping
A network attack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a different VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) by exploiting vulnerabilities in switches.
#### ARP Spoofing
A technique where an attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device, allowing them to intercept network traffic.
#### Rogue DHCP
An unauthorized DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server is introduced into a network. It can assign incorrect IP configurations to devices and potentially intercept traffic.
#### Rogue Access Point
An unauthorized Wi-Fi access point set up by an attacker to trick users into connecting. This allows the attacker to intercept data or launch further attacks.
#### Evil Twin
A rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network, tricking users into connecting to it. Attackers can eavesdrop on data or manipulate network traffic.
#### IP Spoofing
The practice of forging the source IP address in network packets to hide the attacker's identity or launch various types of attacks.
#### De-authentication
Forcibly disconnect users from a Wi-Fi network by sending deauthentication frames, disrupting their connectivity.
