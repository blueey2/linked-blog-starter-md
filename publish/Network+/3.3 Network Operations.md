# Explain high availability and disaster recovery concepts and summarize which is the best solution.
#### Multipathing
Using multiple network paths to ensure network connectivity even if one path fails.
#### Network Interface Card (NIC) Teaming
Aggregating multiple NICs to provide redundancy and load balancing at the network level.
#### Redundant hardware/Clusters
Using duplicate hardware or clusters to ensure service continuity even if one component fails.
## Facilities and infrastructure Support (UPS, PDUS, HVAC, fire supression)

#### Uninterruptable Power supply(UPS)
A device that provides battery backup power in case of electrical outages.
#### Power Distribution Units (PDUS)
Devices that distribute electrical power to multiple equipment.
#### Generator
A machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
#### HVAC
Systems that control temperature, humidity, and air quality in a building.
#### Fire Suppression
Systems and methods designed to control or extinguish fires.
## Redundancy and high availability (HA) concepts

#### Cold Site
a disaster recovery facility that provides essential infrastructure (such as power and physical space) but lacks up-to-date hardware and software. It requires significant setup time before it can become operational during a disaster.
#### Warm Site
a disaster recovery facility that has some pre-configured hardware and software in place. It can be operational faster than a cold site but may still require additional setup and data restoration.
#### Hot site
a disaster recovery facility that is fully equipped with up-to-date hardware, software, and data replication. It can quickly take over operations in case of a disaster, minimizing downtime.
#### Cloud Site
disaster recovery solutions that utilize cloud-based infrastructure and services for data backup, replication, and recovery. It leverages the cloud's scalability and flexibility for disaster recovery purposes.
#### Active-Active
Both primary and backup systems are actively processing data simultaneously, often in a load-balanced configuration. This setup can provide high availability and load distribution.
#### Active-Passive
The primary system is active while the backup is on standby. In the event of a failure, the backup system becomes active, serving as a failover solution.
#### Virtual Routing Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
network protocols used to provide redundancy for default gateway IP addresses. They allow multiple routers to work together to ensure network availability by designating one router as the active gateway and others as backups.
#### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
average time it takes to restore a system or service to normal operation after a failure or outage.
#### Mean time between Failure (MTTB)
the average time between two consecutive failures of a system or component. It measures the reliability of a system.
#### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
the maximum acceptable time frame within which a system or service must be restored after a disaster or failure. It's a critical metric for disaster recovery planning.
#### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
the acceptable data loss, measured in time, in the event of a disaster or failure. It determines how much data can be lost without impacting business operations.
