# Explain the use and purpose of network services.

## DHCP

#### Scope
A range of IP addresses that a DHCP server can assign to devices on a network.
#### Exclusion Ranges
Specific IP addresses or ranges within a DHCP scope that are reserved and cannot be assigned to devices, ensuring they won't have IP conflicts.

#### Reservation
A fixed assignment of a specific IP address to a device, based on its MAC address.

#### Scope Options
The duration for which a DHCP-assigned IP address is valid. After the lease expires, the device may request a renewal.

#### DHCP Relay
A device that forwards DHCP requests and responses between clients on one network segment and a DHCP server on another, allowing centralized DHCP management.

#### IP HELPER/UDP Forwarding
A feature on routers that forwards DHCP and other UDP-based broadcast traffic between different network segments, ensuring DHCP requests reach a DHCP server located on a different subnet.

## DNS

#### A
Used in DNS to map a domain name to an IPv4 address.

#### AAAA
Used to map a domain name to an IPv6 address.

#### CNAME
a DNS record type that allows one domain name to be an alias for another. It's often used for creating subdomain aliases.

#### Mail Exchanger(MX)
Specify mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain.

#### State of Authority(SOA)
Provides essential information about a DNS zone, such as the primary name server for the zone and details on how often the zone data should be refreshed.

#### Pointer (PTR)
Used for reverse lookups to find the domain associated with an IP address.

#### Text(TXT)
Contain arbitrary text and are often used for various purposes, including domain ownership verification, SPF records for email validation, and more.

#### Service(SRV)
Used to specify services available on a domain, including details such as the port number and protocol for the service.

#### Name Server(NS)
Identify the authoritative name servers for a domain. They indicate where DNS queries for the domain should be directed.

#### Global Hierarchy
The root domain at the top, followed by top-level domains (TLDs), second-level domains, and subdomains.
#### Root DNS Server
The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy. They store the IP addresses of TLD name servers and help resolve DNS queries.

#### Internal DNS
Refers to DNS services used within an organization

#### External DNS
Handles public DNS records for a domain that can be accessed from the internet.

#### Zone transfers
Used to replicate DNS zone data between authoritative DNS servers to ensure consistency and redundancy.

#### Authoritative name servers
Hold the official DNS records for a domain and provide responses to DNS queries for that domain.

#### DNS caching
The temporary storage of DNS records on DNS resolvers to reduce the load on authoritative name servers and improve query response times.

#### Recursive lookup
A DNS resolver makes requests to other servers on behalf of the client until it obtains the final answer.

#### Iterative lookup
The resolver queries each server in sequence and combines the responses to find the answer.
