# Explain high availability and disaster recovery concepts and summarize which is the best solution.
#### Multipathing
Using multiple network paths to ensure network connectivity even if one path fails.
#### Network Interface Card (NIC) Teaming
Aggregating multiple NICs to provide redundancy and load balancing at the network level.
#### Redundant hardware/Clusters
Using duplicate hardware or clusters to ensure service continuity even if one component fails.
## Facilities and infrastructure Support (UPS, PDUS, HVAC, fire supression)

#### Uninterruptable Power supply(UPS)
A device that provides battery backup power in case of electrical outages.
#### Power Distribution Units (PDUS)
Devices that distribute electrical power to multiple equipment.
#### Generator
A machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
#### HVAC
Systems that control temperature, humidity, and air quality in a building.
#### Fire Suppression
Systems and methods designed to control or extinguish fires.
## Redundancy and high availability (HA) concepts

#### Cold Site
a disaster recovery facility that provides essential infrastructure (such as power and physical space) but lacks up-to-date hardware and software. It requires significant setup time before it can become operational during a disaster.
#### Warm Site
a disaster recovery facility that has some pre-configured hardware and software in place. It can be operational faster than a cold site but may still require additional setup and data restoration.
#### Hot site
a disaster recovery facility that is fully equipped with up-to-date hardware, software, and data replication. It can quickly take over operations in case of a disaster, minimizing downtime.
#### Cloud Site
disaster recovery solutions that utilize cloud-based infrastructure and services for data backup, replication, and recovery. It leverages the cloud's scalability and flexibility for disaster recovery purposes.
#### Active-Active
Both primary and backup systems are actively processing data simultaneously, often in a load-balanced configuration. This setup can provide high availability and load distribution.
#### Active-Passive
The primary system is active while the backup is on standby. In the event of a failure, the backup system becomes active, serving as a failover solution.
