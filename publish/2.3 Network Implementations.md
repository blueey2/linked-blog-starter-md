# Given a scenario, configure and deploy common Ethernet switching features.

## Ethernet Switching Features

#### Port Tagging/802.1q
A method to tag Ethernet frames with VLAN information, allowing traffic from multiple VLANs to traverse the same physical network.
#### Port Aggregation
Combining multiple physical network links into a single logical link to increase bandwidth and redundancy.
#### LACP
A networking protocol that manages the bundling of multiple physical links into a single logical link (port aggregation).
#### Duplex
The communication mode for network connections, can be half-duplex (one direction at a time) or full-duplex (simultaneous two-way communication).
#### Flow Control
Mechanisms used to manage data transmission between devices to prevent network congestion.
#### Port Mirroring
A feature in switches to duplicate network traffic on one port and send it to another for monitoring and analysis.
#### Port Security
A switch feature that restricts access to network resources by controlling which devices can connect to specific switch ports.
#### Jumbo Frames
Ethernet frames with larger than standard payload size, which can improve network efficiency in certain situations.
#### Auto-Medium-Dependent Interface Crossover (MDI-X)
A technology that allows network devices to automatically configure their Ethernet port connections for straight-through or crossover cables.
#### Media Access Control Address Tables
Tables in network switches that map MAC addresses to the corresponding switch ports for efficient packet forwarding.
#### POE/POE+
Technologies that provide power to network devices through Ethernet cables, eliminating the need for separate power sources.
IEEE 802.3af
#### Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
A network protocol used to prevent loops in Ethernet networks by creating a loop-free logical topology.
IEEE 802.1D
#### CSMA/CD
A network access method used in Ethernet to detect and manage collisions during data transmission
#### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
A protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.
#### Neighbor Discovery Protocol
A protocol in IPv6 networks used for device address resolution and network parameter configuration.
