# Given a scenario, troubleshoot common cable connectivity issues and select the appropriate tools.

## Cable Application

#### Rollover/Console Cable
Also known as a **console cable**, is a type of cable used to establish a direct connection between a computer and a networking device, typically a router or a network switch.
#### Crossover Cable
A type of Ethernet cable used to connect two similar devices directly, rather than connecting through a network switch or hub.
#### Power over Ethernet (PoE)
A technology that allows electrical power and network data to be transmitted over a single Ethernet cable.
## Common issues
#### Attenuation
the reduction in the strength or intensity of a signal as it travels through a medium, such as a cable or fiber optic, resulting in a weaker signal at the receiving end.
#### Interference
the introduction of unwanted signals or noise that disrupt the proper transmission or reception of data in a network.
#### dB Loss
a measurement used to quantify the reduction in signal strength or power, often in the context of signal transmission or attenuation.
#### Incorrect pinout
a situation where the wires in a cable or connector are not arranged or connected in the correct order, which can lead to connectivity issues.
#### Bad ports
physical network or device ports that have hardware or connection problems, making them unreliable for data transmission.
#### Open/Short
a break or discontinuity in a cable or circuit, while a short is an unintended connection between two conductors, both of which can cause network problems.
#### Incorrect Transceivers
optical or electrical modules used in networking equipment that do not match the device's specifications, leading to compatibility issues.
## Common tools
#### Cable Crimper
A tool used to attach connectors to the ends of network cables.
#### Tone Generator
Sends a signal down a cable to help locate and identify it.
#### Optical Time domain Reflectometer (OTDR)
Measures the optical loss and detects faults in fiber optic cables.
#### Multimeter
Measures electrical parameters like voltage, current, and resistance.
#### Wire map
