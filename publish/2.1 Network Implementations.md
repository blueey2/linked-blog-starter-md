# Compare and contrast various devices, their features, and their appropriate placement on the network.

## Networking Devices

#### Layer 2 Switch
Operates at the Data Link Layer of the OSI model. It uses MAC addresses to forward network traffic within a local network. It is more efficient than a hub as it can intelligently determine which port to send data to based on the destination MAC address.

#### Layer 3 Capable Switch
A Layer 2 switch but can also perform routing functions at the Network Layer (Layer 3). This means it can make routing decisions based on IP addresses, allowing it to connect different subnets.

#### Router
A network device that connects different networks together and forwards data between them. It operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) and uses IP addresses to make routing decisions.

#### Hub
A basic network device that operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and blindly broadcasts data to all connected devices. It doesn't make intelligent decisions about where to send data, making it less efficient than switches.

#### Access Point
A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network. It's commonly used in Wi-Fi networks to provide wireless connectivity.

#### Bridge
Connects and filters traffic between two or more network segments, making them function as a single network. It operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and can be used to extend network coverage.

#### Wireless LAN Controller
A central device that manages multiple wireless access points. It helps in configuring, securing, and optimizing the performance of the wireless network.

#### Cable Modem
Connects a computer or network to the internet via a cable television line, providing high-speed internet access.

#### DSL Modem
Connects to the internet by using traditional telephone lines to provide internet access.

#### Repeater
A device that extends the range of a wireless network by receiving and retransmitting signals. It helps improve coverage in areas with weak signals.

#### Voice Gateway
Converts voice calls between different networks, such as traditional phone lines and Voice over IP (VoIP) networks, enabling seamless communication.

#### Media Converter
Used to convert the physical media type of a network connection, such as from fiber optic to copper, to enable the connection of different types of network equipment.

#### VPN Headend
A device or server that serves as the entry point for a Virtual Private Network (VPN), allowing remote users to securely access a private network over the internet.

## Networked Devices

#### Voice over internet protocol (VOIP)
A device that allows voice communication over the internet, enabling phone calls through digital data rather than traditional phone lines.

#### Physical access Control Devices
Systems and devices that manage and restrict access to physical spaces or assets, often using methods like keycards, biometrics, or PIN codes.

#### Industiral Control Systems/Supervisory Control and data acquisition (SCADA)
Systems used in industrial settings to monitor and control machinery and processes, often critical in manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure.
