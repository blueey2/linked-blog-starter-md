# Given a scenario, apply network hardening techniques.
## Best Practices
#### Secure SNMP
Involves implementing security measures like SNMPv3 (version 3) with authentication and encryption to protect against unauthorized access and data interception.
#### Router Advertisement Guard (RAG)
A feature in network switches that prevents rogue or unauthorized devices from sending router advertisements.
#### Port Security
Restricts and controls access to switch ports by allowing only specific devices (based on MAC addresses) to connect.
#### Dynamic ARP Inspection
A security feature that filters and validates ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packets to prevent ARP spoofing attacks.
#### Control Plane Policing (CPP)
A mechanism that limits the rate at which control plane traffic (network management and control traffic) is processed by a device.
#### Private VLANS
Segment a broadcast domain into smaller, isolated subdomains. They restrict communication between devices within the same VLAN, enhancing network security by reducing the potential attack surface.
#### DHCP Snooping
A security feature that prevents rogue DHCP servers from distributing IP addresses on the network. It verifies the legitimacy of DHCP servers.
#### Access Control List (ACL)
Rule-based filters that control network traffic by allowing or denying specific traffic based on source and destination addresses, ports, and protocols.
#### Firewall Rules
Policies that determine how network traffic is allowed or blocked at a network perimeter. They provide a crucial layer of security.
#### Implicit Deny
A default rule that denies all traffic that does not match any of the explicitly defined allow rules in a firewall or ACL.
#### Explicit Deny
Explicitly specifies that certain traffic is not allowed, even if it would otherwise be permitted by other rules.

## Wireless Security

#### MAC Filtering
A security feature used in wireless networks. It involves creating a list of approved MAC addresses (unique hardware addresses of devices) that are allowed to connect to a network
#### Antenna Placement
The strategic positioning of wireless antennas in a network to optimize signal strength and coverage.
#### Power levels
The transmit power of a wireless access point or device.
#### Wireless Client Isolation
A security feature that prevents devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network from communicating with each other.
#### Guest Network Isolation
A security feature that separates guest devices on a network from the main or internal network.
#### Pre-shared Keys (PSKs)
a form of security authentication used in Wi-Fi networks. Devices must enter a shared password (key) to connect to the network.
#### EAP
Authentication framework often used in enterprise wireless networks. It provides a variety of methods for secure authentication, including certificate-based and username/password-based authentication.
#### Geofencing
A location-based technology that uses GPS or RFID to create virtual boundaries in the real world. In the context of networking, it can be used to control access based on the physical location of a device.
#### Captive Portal
A web page that users must interact with before they are granted access to a public Wi-Fi network. It is often used in places like hotels or cafes to provide terms of use or collect user information.
