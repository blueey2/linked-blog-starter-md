# **OSI Model**
## Physical layer
Data is referred to as **BITS** at the physical layer
**Devices at Layer 1**
	Ethernet Cable
	Fiber optic cable
	Network Interface card
	Hub
Also we figure out what type of topology we use at this layer.
## Data link layer
Data is referred to as **frames** at the data link link
**MAC(Media Access Control)**
	Physical Addressing
		48bit address that makes a device unique from every other device.
	Logical Topology
	Method Of Transmission
**LLC (Logical Link Control)**
	Connection Services
	Synchronization of Transmissions
	**Devices at Layer 2**
		Layer 2 Switch
## Network Link Layer
Data is referred to as **packets** at the Network link layer
**Logical Addressing**
**Devices**
	Router
	Layer 3 Switch
**Switching**
	Packet switching
		Making a forwarding decision 
**Connection Services**
	Flow Control
## Transport Layer
Data is referred to as **segments** at the Transport layer
**TCP/UDP**

## Session layer

## Presentation Layer

## Application layer
