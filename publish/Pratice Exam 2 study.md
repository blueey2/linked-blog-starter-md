**Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)**
	Used to group numerous physical ports to make on high bandwidth path.
		_This method can increase bandwidth and therefore, throughput_

**Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**
	A network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for ethernet networks to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast storms that result from them
		_This method accomplishes loop prevention and network redundancy management in ethernet networks by creating a loop-free topology and disabling redundant paths._
		
**Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BDPU)**
	Used by STP to prevent the bridge loops
		_Exchanges information between network bridges in order to prevent loops and ensure efficient data forwarding in Ethernet Networks_

**Physical Layer**
	Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium
