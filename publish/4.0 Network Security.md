# Explain common security concepts.

#### Zero-Day
A security vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor or lacks a fix, making it susceptible to exploitation.
#### Zero Trust
A security model where no entity, whether inside or outside the network, is inherently trusted, and verification is required from everyone trying to access resources.
#### Defense in Depth
Using multiple layers of security measures to protect an organization's assets.
#### Network segmentation Enforcement
Dividing a network into smaller segments with controlled access between them to limit the spread of threats.
#### Screened Subnet (DMZ)
A network segment that acts as a buffer between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network.
#### Network Access Control
Enforcing security policies to determine who or what can access the network.
## Authentication Methods

#### Multifactor
Requiring more than one authentication method (e.g., password, fingerprint, token) for user verification.
#### TACAS+
A network access control protocol used for user authentication, authorization, and accounting.
#### Single Sign On (SSO)
Allowing users to access multiple services with a single set of login credentials.
#### RADIUS
A networking protocol used for remote authentication and accounting
#### LDAP
a protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services.
#### Kerberos
A network authentication protocol that uses secret-key cryptography.
#### Local Authentication
Authenticating users against a locally stored database.
#### 802.1x
A standard for port-based network access control that provides authentication and authorization.
#### Extensible authentication Protocol (EAP)
A framework for various authentication methods, often used in wireless networks.
## Risk Management

#### Security Risk Assessments
Evaluating potential security risks, including threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and posture assessment.
#### Business Risk Assessments
Assessing the potential risks and impacts to an organization's business processes and vendors.
## Security Information and event management (SIEM)
#### SIEM
A system that collects and analyzes security event data from various sources to provide insights into an organization's security posture
