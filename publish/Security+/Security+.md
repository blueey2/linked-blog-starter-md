<u>Watering Hole Attack</u>:
	A type of security attack which the attacker compromises a website that a certain targeted group of people often visit. The attacker infects the site with malicious code. When the targets visit that site they become infected with malware.

<u>Principles</u>
	The priciples of social engineering. The art of manipulating people to disclose confidential information, perform actions, or bypass security controls.
		Authority:
			Attackers may impersonate figures of authority, Such as IT personnel or company executives to gain trust.
		Intimidation:
			Attackers use threats, fear, or coercion to force individuals into compliance.
		Consensus:
			People tend to follow the actions of others.
			Scenarios where individuals might be influenced by the actions of others.
		Scarcity:
			Creating a perception of limited availability or scarcity can drive individuals to take actions they might not otherwise consider.
		Familiarity:
			People trust other people their familiar with. Attackers exploit this by impersonating someone the victim trusts.
		Trust:
			Attackers go through great length to gain trust from a victim.
		Urgency:
			Creating a sense of urgency can cause individuals to act quickly without proper verification.
<u>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</u>
	A security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into websites that aren then viewed by other users

<u>Smishing</u>
	A type of phishing conducted through SMS (Short message service)
	
<u>SPam over Internet Telephony (SPIT)</u>
	The unwanted, unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate voice messages sent over internet telephony services, such as VOIP.

<u>Pharming</u>
	A cyberattack that involves redirecting the traffic of a website to a fraudulent or malicious website without the users knowledge.

<u></u>
<u>C2 Server</u>
	A central server used by attackers to send commands and receive information from compromised devices within a botnet or malware infected network.

<u>Packet Sniffer</u>
	A network analyzer is a tool or software application used to capture and analyze data packets transmitted over a network. Used for troubleshooting, monitoring, and security analysis.

<u>PUP (Potentially unwanted program)</u>
	Software that while not explicitly malicious may exhibit behaviors or characteristics that users may find undesirable.

<u>Fileless Virus</u>
	A type of malware that operates in the systems memory without leaving traces on the hard drive.

<u>Rootkit</u>
	A type of malicious software designed to hide its existence or the existence of other malicious processes or programs on a computer network. Rootkits typically gain privileged access often at the root or kernel level of an OS and aim to conceal their presence.

<u>Spraying attack</u>
	A type of cyber attack where an attacker systematically attempts to compromise a large number of accounts or systems by using a limited set of credentials.

<u>Replay attack</u>
	A type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts and maliciously retransmits valid data transmission between two parties.

<u>Rainbow Table</u>
	A precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, typically used for password hashing. IT contains a mapping between plaintext passwords and their corresponding hash values.

<u>ML (Machine Learning)</u>
	A field of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

<u>Birthday Attack</u>
	A type of cryptographic attack that exploits the probability of collisions in has functions.
