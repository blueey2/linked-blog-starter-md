<u>Watering Hole Attack</u>:
	A type of security attack which the attacker compromises a website that a certain targeted group of people often visit. The attacker infects the site with malicious code. When the targets visit that site they become infected with malware.

<u>Principles</u>
	The priciples of social engineering. The art of manipulating people to disclose confidential information, perform actions, or bypass security controls.
		Authority:
			Attackers may impersonate figures of authority, Such as IT personnel or company executives to gain trust.
		Intimidation:
			Attackers use threats, fear, or coercion to force individuals into compliance.
		Consensus:
			People tend to follow the actions of others.
			Scenarios where individuals might be influenced by the actions of others.
		Scarcity:
			Creating a perception of limited availability or scarcity can drive individuals to take actions they might not otherwise consider.
		Familiarity:
			People trust other people their familiar with. Attackers exploit this by impersonating someone the victim trusts.
		Trust:
			Attackers go through great length to gain trust from a victim.
		Urgency:
			Creating a sense of urgency can cause individuals to act quickly without proper verification.
<u>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</u>
	A security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into websites that aren then viewed by other users

<u>Smishing</u>
	A type of phishing conducted through SMS (Short message service)
	
<u>SPam over Internet Telephony (SPIT)</u>
	The unwanted, unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate voice messages sent over internet telephony services, such as VOIP.

<u>Pharming</u>
	A cyberattack that involves redirecting the traffic of a website to a fraudulent or malicious website without the users knowledge.

<u>C2 Server</u>
	A central server used by attackers to send commands and receive information from compromised devices within a botnet or malware infected network.

<u>Packet Sniffer</u>
	A network analyzer is a tool or software application used to capture and analyze data packets transmitted over a network. Used for troubleshooting, monitoring, and security analysis.

<u>PUP (Potentially unwanted program)</u>
	Software that while not explicitly malicious may exhibit behaviors or characteristics that users may find undesirable.

<u>Fileless Virus</u>
	A type of malware that operates in the systems memory without leaving traces on the hard drive.

<u>Rootkit</u>
	A type of malicious software designed to hide its existence or the existence of other malicious processes or programs on a computer network. Rootkits typically gain privileged access often at the root or kernel level of an OS and aim to conceal their presence.

<u>Spraying attack</u>
	A type of cyber attack where an attacker systematically attempts to compromise a large number of accounts or systems by using a limited set of credentials.

<u>Replay attack</u>
	A type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts and maliciously retransmits valid data transmission between two parties.

<u>Rainbow Table</u>
	A precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, typically used for password hashing. IT contains a mapping between plaintext passwords and their corresponding hash values.

<u>ML (Machine Learning)</u>
	A field of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

<u>Birthday Attack</u>
	A type of cryptographic attack that exploits the probability of collisions in has functions.

<u>Hash Collision</u>
	When two different inputs produce the same hash value.

<u>cross-site scripting (XSS)</u>
	A web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
	They can execute in the context of a users browser leading to potential breaches.

<u>SQL Injection</u>
	A type of cybersecurity attack that occurs when an attcker inserts malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters used by a web application.
	
	SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1' --' AND Password = 'input_password';

<u>DLL (Dynamic Link Library)</u>
	A file format used to store a set of functions that can be executed and shared by multiple programs simultaneously.

<u>DLL Injection</u>
	A technique used in software development and cybersecurity where an external DLL is forced into the address space of a running process.

<u>Pointer dereference</u>
	Refers to the process of accessing the value stored at the memory address pointed to by a pointer. They store memory addresses and when you dereference a pointer you retrieve the actual value stored at that address.

<u>LDAP injection</u>
	A type of cyber attack that occurs when an attacker injects malicious LDAP code into input fields or parameters used by an application to interreact with LDAP directories.
	Look for inputs that include special characters such as * & = or other LDAP-specific operators.

<u>XML injection</u>
	A type of cyber attack that occurs when an attacker injects malicious XML code into an application or a system that parses XML data.
	Look for inputs that include XML specific characters such as < > & etc.

<u>Directory traversal attack</u>
	AKA dot-dot slash attack, is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker attempts to access files and directories outside the intended directory structure.

<u>Buffer overflow</u>
	A type of software vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to a block of memory or buffer than it was allocated to hold.

<u>Integer overflow</u>
	A vulnerability that occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum representable value for the data type used to store it.

<u>Race Condition</u>
	A type of software vulnerability that occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events such as the order of execution of multiple threads or processes.

<u>SSRF (Server side request forgery)</u>
	A vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to make requests to internal resources from a vulnerable server.

<u>CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery)</u>
	A vulnerability where an attacker tricks a victim into unintentionally making a request to a web application on which the victim is authenticated.

<u>API (Application Programming Interface)</u>
	A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
